# Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented for the KHUSHBOO.E.IRAM e-commerce platform to ensure professional-grade security similar to major e-commerce stores like Amazon.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 rounds before storage
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with HTTP-only cookies and secure flag in production
- **JWT Tokens**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication with 7-day expiration
- **Google OAuth**: Optional Google sign-in integration for enhanced user convenience
- **Password Reset**: Secure token-based password reset with 1-hour expiration

### Admin Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin flag (`isAdmin`) in user table to distinguish admin users
- **Backend Middleware**: `requireAuth` and `requireAdmin` middleware functions protect sensitive routes
- **Frontend Protection**: Admin panel checks user role before rendering and redirects non-admin users
- **Environment-Based Credentials**: Admin credentials must be set via environment variables (ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD)

## API Security

### Protected Endpoints

#### Admin-Only Routes (requireAdmin middleware)
- `POST /api/products` - Create new products
- `PATCH /api/products/:id` - Update existing products
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete products

#### Authenticated Routes (requireAuth middleware)
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - View specific order (user can only view their own orders unless admin)
- `GET /api/orders/user/:userId` - View user orders (user can only view their own orders unless admin)

#### Public Routes
- `GET /api/products` - View all products
- `GET /api/products/:id` - View specific product
- `GET /api/categories` - View all categories
- `GET /api/cart` - View cart (session or user-based)
- `POST /api/cart` - Add to cart
- `POST /api/orders` - Create order (supports both guest and authenticated users)

### Input Validation
- **Zod Schemas**: All API endpoints validate input using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Drizzle ORM prevents SQL injection by properly sanitizing queries
- **XSS Protection**: React's rendering provides built-in XSS protection

## Production Security

### Environment Variables
The application enforces proper secret configuration in production:

#### Required in Production
- `JWT_SECRET` - Must be set and not use default value
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Must be set and not use default value
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin user email address
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Strong admin password (minimum 8 characters)

#### Optional
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - For Google OAuth integration
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - For Google OAuth integration
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically provided by Replit

### Security Checks
- Application exits with error if production secrets use default values
- Seed script refuses to create admin with default password in production
- All sensitive operations require authentication

## Data Protection

### User Data
- Passwords never stored in plain text (bcrypt hashing)
- Reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- User sessions expire after 7 days
- Sensitive user data excluded from API responses

### Order Security
- Users can only view their own orders
- Admin users can view all orders
- Order data includes user association for proper authorization

### Cart Security
- Guest carts use session ID
- Authenticated user carts use user ID
- Proper isolation between guest and authenticated carts
- Cart cleared after successful order placement

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Both frontend and backend validation/authorization
3. **Secure by Default**: Production mode requires proper configuration
4. **Session Security**: HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks on session data
5. **HTTPS Ready**: Secure flag on cookies in production for HTTPS
6. **No Sensitive Data Logging**: Passwords and tokens never logged to console in production

## Admin Panel Access

### Default Admin Account
An admin account is created during database seeding if ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables are set.

**Important**: 
- Never use default credentials in production
- Change admin password immediately after first login
- Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts

### Admin Capabilities
Administrators can:
- Add, edit, and delete products
- Manage product categories
- View all customer orders
- Access admin panel at `/admin`

## Security Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. Set strong, unique values for JWT_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET
2. Enable HTTPS and ensure secure cookies are enabled
3. Regularly rotate admin passwords
4. Monitor admin access logs
5. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
6. Add CSRF protection middleware
7. Enable 2FA for admin accounts (future enhancement)
8. Implement email delivery for password reset (currently console-logged)

### For Development
1. Use environment variables for all secrets
2. Never commit secrets to version control
3. Test with real authentication flows
4. Verify admin access controls regularly
